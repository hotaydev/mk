# The `mk` command

> It creates a directory and enter it. Two commands in one.

---

When we create a folder, we usually want to enter it, needing to use booth, `mkdir` and `cd`. With `mk`, booths are done in one command.

## Installation

Install it with:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hotaydev/mk/main/install.sh)"
```

## Usage

Use it with `mk <folder>`. It will create and enter the argument folder.
